# Lab Run Optimizer
The primary goal of this project is to map routes through the Lawrence University campus and optimize the path taken to complete a lab run.

## Steps to completion
- [ ] Set up graph and node objects in JS
- [ ] Overlay a canvas on a campus map and allow for node creation by clicks
- [ ] Allow for edge creation by dragging between nodes
- [ ] Generate a route map of campus
- [ ] Set route map to preload
- [ ] Implement shortest-path algorithim
- [ ] Create itinerary form
- [ ] Connect itinerary to shortest-path algorithim
- [ ] Style for mobile
- [ ] Route-interrupt feature (*i.e. reset the path when more paper/toner is needed*)
